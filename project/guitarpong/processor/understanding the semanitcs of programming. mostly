understanding the semanitcs of programming. mostly theoretical results. verify that the program does what it wants to
The ambition is to use Open SSL code.

V3 constraint s<5 y>15 (V3 will give bindings of)

SMT (extend of types of reasoning beyond booleans) solved. V3. Package give a set of constraints and whether its satisfiable. 

Open source. look it up online. 

V3 Everest. Literally give V3 formulas 100,000 variables simultaneously. routinely find that V3. 

In terms of logical reasoning. Solvers like V3 are way more powerful than humans. 

Connect Perceptual AI to more higher level thinking / reason higher. 

IDEAS-- Capabilities. Product Teams are interested in. 
Excel -- Dynamic Program.

Implemention of TLS. -- 

Bug in code of Open SSL. Lots of routers use it. 

With that bug you can copy memory 

fully verified implementation of code

evercrypt.

can't coerce program thats not meant to be written.\

Consider a Graduate Degree!! Important to understand Research is a like a mentorship. Subtle transfer of skill b/w Professor and Student. 

Recommend Considering Graduate School --- Some of these skills take time to develop and build.
